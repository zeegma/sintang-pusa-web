· · ────── Brief Description ────── · ·

Established in 2019, PUP Sintang Pusa started as a Facebook page dedicated to the cats of PUP Sta. Mesa campus. Then a momentum was gained when the beloved tabby named Pogi was tragically killed before his adoption, leading to a movement among students, faculty, and alumni for raising awareness and protecting cats. Now, the organization aims to save and care for the remaining campus cats through charitable efforts and activities.

· · ────── Goals ────── · ·

- Advertise and raise awareness about the cats in PUP
- Feed the cats residing within the campus
- Regularly monitor resident cats
- Safekeep monetary and in-kind donations for the cats
- Gather volunteers to easily mobilize the purpose of the organization
- Reach out to the community to form networks that will benefit the cats, and
- Raise funds through activities and projects whose proceeds will shoulder the needs of the organization's operations
