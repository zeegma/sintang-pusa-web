· · ────── Brief Description ────── · ·

Established in 2019, PUP Sintang Pusa started as a Facebook page dedicated to the cats of PUP Sta. Mesa campus. Then a momentum was gained when the beloved tabby named Pogi was tragically killed before his adoption, leading to a movement among students, faculty, and alumni for raising awareness and protecting cats. Now, the organization aims to save and care for the remaining campus cats through charitable efforts and activities.
