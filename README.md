# GUIDELINES

Please consider the following on creating the HTML file:

- Kebab case should be used on naming attribute values (e.g. kebab-case)
- Follow 2 spaces indentation (already set the file for 2 spaces so keep it consistent on your end)
- Separate sections with a new line
- Do NOT separate the \<head> and \<body> tag with a new line
- Add comments on necessary parts only, don't <i>overdocument</i> the markup code
- Suggest more guidelines to follow here (I may have missed some important ones)

# TODO

Please mark the checkbox once your part is done:

- [ ] UI
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] Reflection
